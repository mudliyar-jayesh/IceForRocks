# IceForRocks 
## A file-based database library.

### Why?
I just have a project, that solely runs on file inputs from the user, and runs locally on the user's server. 
Deploying a whole database there, just for files seemed too much. 
Also, Converting the file data then breaking them down to database compatible structres was too much. 

But the most important reason is, that I can! 😂

### Not Released!
I just started this project, a local nuget store on my machine has the version 1. 

I have a LOT, i mean a LOT of improvements before this actually becomes production ready. 
I am using this in a project because it works for the purpose I need it to work for. 

Soon I will complete the official version 1.


### What Now? 
Explore the code, it ain't that much. but Suggestions are ALWAYS WELCOME! 🫡🤝
